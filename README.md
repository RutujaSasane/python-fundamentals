# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains my daily practice of Python fundamentals as part of rebuilding strong programming basics.

## Contents
- Day 1: Python basics practice
  - Check even or odd numbers
  - Swap two numbers (with and without temporary variable)
  - Find the length of a string
  - Print numbers using loops
- Day 2: Conditions, operators, and type conversion
  - Positive, negative, or zero check
  - Largest of two numbers
  - Arithmetic operators
  - Logical operators
  - Type conversion
  - Even numbers using loop
- Day 3: Control flow using conditionals
  - Largest of three numbers
  - Voting eligibility check
  - Grade classification using if-elif ladder
  - Nested if (positive number and even/odd check)
  - Simple calculator using conditionals
- Day 4: Loops and logic building
  - Count digits in a number
  - Reverse a number
  - Sum of digits
  - Prime number check
  - Star pattern printing
  - Numbers divisible by 3 and 5

## Goal
To build strong Python fundamentals through consistent daily practice and clear understanding of core concepts.

## Notes
- All code in this repository is written and practiced by me.
- Focus is on clarity and correctness rather than advanced optimizations.
